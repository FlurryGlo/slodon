## For Core Developers

We firmly uphold the principle that individuals who have contributed to a project deserve to be duly rewarded. Specifically, core developers are eligible to receive financial compensation from the project.

It is imperative to note that monetary benefits can only be provided once the project has yielded profits. These benefits will be allocated based on predefined criteria, ensuring fairness and adherence to specific guidelines. In this system, `50%` of the project's financial value is designated for the founders, a proposition that is both rational and equitable. The remaining `50%` will be distributed among the core developers, with the proportion of their compensation determined by the extent of their contributions relative to the entire code base.
